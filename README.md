Minishell 42
Minishell 42 is a project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to create a fully functional shell implementation with advanced features and robust command execution capabilities. It provides a user-friendly command line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system and execute various commands.

Features
Minishell 42 offers an extensive range of features to enhance the user experience and provide a powerful shell environment. Some of the key features include:

1. Command Execution
Minishell supports the execution of external commands by forking a child process and using the execve system call to run the command in the child process. This allows users to run any executable files located in their system's PATH.

2. Built-in Commands
The shell includes several built-in commands that are executed directly by the shell itself, without the need for forking a new process. These commands include cd, echo, env, and exit. The built-in commands provide essential functionalities and enhance the shell's usability.

3. Environment Variables
Minishell allows users to view and modify environment variables using the env command. It provides the ability to list all environment variables and their values, as well as create new variables and delete existing ones. This feature enables users to customize their shell environment to suit their specific needs.

4. Redirection and Pipes
The shell supports advanced input/output redirection and pipe functionality. Users can redirect command input and output to/from files using the < and > symbols, respectively. This enables users to process data from files or save command output to files. Additionally, Minishell allows the creation of pipelines by connecting multiple commands with the | symbol, facilitating the seamless flow of data between commands.

5. Signal Handling
Minishell handles common Unix signals such as Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT) to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience. When a running command receives a SIGINT signal (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), Minishell forwards the signal to the command, allowing users to terminate the command execution if needed.

6. Command Line Editing
To enhance productivity and ease of use, Minishell incorporates command line editing capabilities using the GNU Readline library. Users can take advantage of features such as line editing, command history navigation using arrow keys, and autocompletion using the Tab key. These functionalities streamline the command entry process and provide a more efficient workflow.

7. Scripting Support
Minishell allows users to write shell scripts using the full power of the shell's syntax. Shell scripts are sequences of commands that can be executed as a single entity, enabling users to automate repetitive tasks or create complex command sequences. Minishell provides a convenient environment for writing, debugging, and executing shell scripts.

Getting Started
To get started with Minishell 42, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Change to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd minishell
Compile the code:

go
Copy code
make
Run the shell:

bash
Copy code
./minishell
Usage
Once you have launched Minishell 42, you can start entering commands. The shell supports a variety of features and commands:

External Commands: You can execute external commands by typing the command name followed by any necessary arguments.

Built-in Commands: The shell includes several built-in commands that can be executed directly by the shell. These commands include cd, echo, env, and exit. To execute a built-in command, simply enter the command name followed by any required arguments.

Redirection and Pipes: Minishell supports input/output redirection and pipe functionality. You can use the < symbol to redirect input from a file, the > symbol to redirect output to a file, and the | symbol to create a pipeline.

Environment Variables: You can view and modify environment variables using the env command. To set a new variable, use the syntax VAR_NAME=VALUE. To delete a variable, use the unset VAR_NAME command.

Signal Handling: Minishell handles common Unix signals such as Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT). Pressing Ctrl+C will send a SIGINT signal to the current running command, allowing you to terminate it.

Command Line Editing: Minishell uses the GNU Readline library for line editing and command history. You can use arrow keys to navigate through command history, and the Tab key for autocompletion.

For more detailed information on command syntax and available options, please refer to the project documentation.
